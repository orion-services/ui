## About Orion Services

Collaborative learning applications encompass a range of essential features,
such as communication, group management, and workflow control, among others.
However, these features become complex due to the need for data synchronization
among users, ensuring high speed and availability, and scaling to accommodate a
large number of students.

To address these challenges and streamline the development of collaborative
learning applications, Orion Services offers a suite of scalable, free, and
open-source microservices under the Apache 2.0 license.
